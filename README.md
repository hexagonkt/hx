# Application Templates

Each subdirectory starting with `hexagon_` inside this module is a different template.

You can package the templates locally with the command:

    # TODO Addapt to Maven Archetypes
    ./gradlew clean && ./gradlew processTemplate

## Starters Code

For convenience, the code used to generate the templates is in `src/`. It is tested before being
copied to the template.

# Kotlin Scripting

To run Kotlin scripts you have to install [Kotlin] and make the `kotlin` binary accesible in the
path.

After that, you can run Kotlin scripts with: `./script_name.main.kts args` (assuming that you marked
the script as executable: `chmod +x script_name.main.kts`).

[Kotlin]: https://kotlinlang.org

### Set up IntelliJ
To debug Kotlin scripts, an IntelliJ Java module must be created on the script directory.
